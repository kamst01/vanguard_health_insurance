						<p>PRIVACY POLICY
If you are an individual who is a user of this website, who accesses or responds to advertisements or offers e-mailed or displayed to you relating to this website, or who is otherwise as a user of the services provided by gomediquote.com, this Privacy Policy is intended to describe for you, among other things:

The information we collect about you
How we use the information we collect
With whom we share your information
How you can access your information
Your choices about collection and use of your information
HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully when using our website or services, responding to our advertisements and offers, or transacting business with us. By using our website, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. (This Privacy Policy does not apply to our vendors, contractors and employees.)

If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please refer to the end of this Privacy Policy for information on how to contact us.

THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU

In General. We may collect personal information that can identify you such as your name and e-mail address, as well as other information that does not identify you such as your zip code. When you provide personal information through our website, the information may be sent to gomediquote.com servers located in the United States and other countries around the world.

Information You Provide. As mentioned above, we may collect information you submit on our website, such as your name, e-mail address and zip code. We may also track your interaction with email advertisements sent to you by gomediquote.com or our e-mail service providers on our behalf (for example, when you register, purchase, or browse in response to such emails).

Information from Other Sources. We may also periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from business partners, contractors and other third parties, as well as information from public databases. Examples of information that we may receive include information about your home and additional demographic information.

Use of Cookies and Other Technologies to Automatically Collect Information. We and our authorized service providers, advertising companies, and ad networks may use various activity tracking technologies, such as cookies, pixels and web beacons, to collect information from your computer and about your activities on our website or interaction with our advertisements (see "Information Collected by Third Parties" below). We and these companies may automatically collect information from your browser when you visit our website. This information may include your IP address, your browser type and language, access times, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us or them (see "Cookies" below) and the referring website address.

Cookies. When you visit our website, we may assign your computer one or more cookies, to facilitate access to our website, to personalize your online experience, and to record information about your visit to our website. A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of your computer that allows your computer's browser to store your preferences and allows gomediquote.com, our authorized service providers, advertising companies and ad networks to identify you by a unique identifier and associate this with corresponding information in our or their database. Through the use of a cookie, we and these companies may store your non-personally identifiable registration information and user preferences and may also automatically collect information about your online activity on websites, such as the web pages you visit, the links or advertisements you click, or the other actions you conduct while on websites. In addition, gomediquote.com may set a cookie on your computer when you view our advertisements delivered on or in connection with a third-party website you are visiting. After a cookie is set, gomediquote.com may track how you interact with the advertisement (for example, registering, purchasing, browsing, etc.). Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to use some of the interactive features offered on our website. We do not tie tracking cookies used for behavioral or targeted advertising purposes to any personal information you submit while on our website; however, cookies may be tied to your personal information for purposes of matching you with insurance companies and managing our relationships with these companies and other websites from which you may have been referred to us. They do NOT, however, collect personal information. Although we may place or allow third parties to place their cookies when you visit our website (as described more fully in the subsection below entitled "Targeted or Behavioral Advertising"), we do not have access or control over third party cookies, nor does our Privacy Policy cover the use of cookies by third parties.

Other Technologies. We may use other standard Internet activity tracking technologies, such as web beacons and similar technologies, to track your use on our website or your interaction with our advertisements. A web beacon is a programming code used to display an image on a web page and can also transfer an individual's user identification to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about the individual. Such information may be used in targeted or behavioral advertising, as well as for the other uses described in this paragraph. We may include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters or online advertisements to determine whether messages have been opened or acted upon. We may use the information we obtain in this manner to customize the services and offers we provide our website's visitors, to deliver targeted advertisements, and to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, programming or other activities. We do not tie web beacons to any personal information you submit while on our website.

HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

In general. We may use information that we collect about you to:

deliver the products and services that you have requested (for example, to provide you with Medicare supplemental insurance quotes and/or match you with insurance companies);
send you offers that you have opted in to receive;
manage your relationship with us and provide you with customer support;
perform research and analysis about your use of, or interest in, our products, services or content, or products, services or content offered by others;
communicate with you by e-mail, postal mail, telephone and/or mobile devices about products or services that may be of interest to you either from us or third parties;
develop and display content and advertising (such as targeted ads) tailored to your interests on our websites and other websites;
enforce our terms and conditions;
protect gomediquote.com, our websites, our customers and/or our other users from fraud, hacking or other harm;
cooperate with legal, criminal or regulatory investigations or proceedings;
manage our business; and
perform functions as otherwise described to you at the time of information collection.
WITH WHOM WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION

We do not share, sell, rent or trade your personal information with third parties other than as disclosed within this Privacy Policy.

We want you to understand when and with whom we may share personal or other information we have collected about you or your activities on our website, while using our services or in your other interactions (such as responding to e-mails) with us.

Authorized Service Providers. We may share your personal information with our authorized service providers that perform certain services on our behalf. For example, we may engage other companies to provide data storage, to assist in marketing gomediquote.com</p>
