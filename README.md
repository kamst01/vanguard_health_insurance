# Vanguard Health Insurance

⚠️ Archived Project for Portfilio Purposes ⚠️

Vanguard Health Insurance was a client of mine from 2018. It was my third project where I was the sole developer and designer. I had direct communications with the Owner and CEO throughout the process. The turnaround time was 1 month 8 days from finished design to website live.

## Things learned from this project:
- Image sizes have a huge impact
- This is my first production project to use 3rd party packages
- Minimizing the amount of 3rd party packages can provide a huge bump in speed
- My first true A/B Testing based off analtyics was done on this site
- Clean code and code comments for when updating later on
- Appropriate names / descriptions for syntax
- Speaking and communicating efficiently with the client in order to obtain or describe the correct information, the first time
