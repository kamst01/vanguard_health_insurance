# Vanguard Health Insurance

## Summary

⚠️ Archived Project for Portfilio Purposes ⚠️

Vanguard Health Insurance was a client of mine from 2018. It was my third project where I was the sole developer and designer. I had direct communications with the Owner and CEO throughout the process. The turnaround time was 1 month 8 days from finished design to website live.

## Purpose
Create a website that would help customer's feel confident, portray knowledge and strength, something you can lean on when you need insurance. Main objective was to fill out the form to then forward to a remote caller.

## Technologies

### CSS
I wrote some custom CSS for this project.

### Bootstrap
I this was my first production project to use a framework like Bootstrap. It created bottle necks with customization, but really helped me keep a cohesive design and keep the design across the website. I also used a Bootstrap Theme for this project, provided by the client.

### jQuery
This was my first time ever using jQuery instead of Javascript, mainly because the Boostrap Theme provided by the client was already using jQuery. I did not see a reason to mix the two together; and at the time, jQuery provided a lot of things that Javascript did not.

## Things learned from this project:
- Image sizes have a huge impact
- This is my first production project to use 3rd party packages
- Minimizing the amount of 3rd party packages can provide a huge bump in speed
- My first true A/B Testing based off analtyics was done on this site
- Clean code and code comments for when updating later on
- Appropriate names / descriptions for syntax
- Speaking and communicating efficiently with the client in order to obtain or describe the correct information, the first time
